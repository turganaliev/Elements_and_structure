    <h2>About Moon</h2>
    <p>The <em>Moon</em> is an astronomical body orbiting <strong>Earth</strong> as its only natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System,
      and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary).<br />The Moon is, after
      Jupiter's satellite Io, the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities are known</p>

    <h2>Name and ethymology</h2>
    <p>The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply the Moon, with a capital M. The noun moon is derived from
      Old English mōna, which (like all its Germanic cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic *mēnōn, which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European
      *mēnsis "month" (from earlier *mēnōt, genitive *mēneses) which may be related to the verb "measure" (of time).</p>

  <div id="formation">
    <h2>Formation</h2>
    <p>The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely accepted explanation is that
      the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a hypothetical Mars-sized body called Theia.
      New research of Moon rocks, although not rejecting the Theia hypothesis, suggests that the Moon may be older than previously thought.</p>

    <h3 id="orbit">Orbit</h3>
    <p>The Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars about once every 27.3 days
      (its sidereal period). However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer
      for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5 days</p>

    <h3 id="appearance">Appearance from Earth</h3>
    <p>The Moon is in synchronous rotation as it orbits Earth; it rotates about its axis in about the same time it takes to orbit Earth.
      This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, because of the effect of libration, about 59% of
      the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth. The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side, and the opposite the far side.
      The far side is often inaccurately called the "dark side", but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side: once every 29.5 Earth days.
      During new moon, the near side is dark</p>

    <h3 id="tidal">Tidal effects</h3>
    <p>The gravitational attraction that masses have for one another decreases inversely with the square of the distance of those masses
      from each other. As a result, the slightly greater attraction that the Moon has for the side of Earth closest to the Moon, as compared to
      the part of the Earth opposite the Moon, results in tidal forces. Tidal forces affect both the Earth's crust and oceans.</p>
